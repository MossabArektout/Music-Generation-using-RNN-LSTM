# AI-Driven Music Generation Project 🎶

This repository contains the code and resources for a project on music generation using artificial intelligence. Our model generates original musical compositions by learning from a dataset of folk tunes, specifically utilizing the ABC Notation format. The project's goal is to explore the creative potential of AI in music and the ways it can capture musical structure and harmony.

## 📄 Preprint Paper

For a detailed overview of the project methodology, literature review, data collection, and evaluation, please refer to our preprint paper on ResearchGate:
**[Music Generation Project Preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385782855_MUSIC_GENERATION_USING_RNN-LSTM)**

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **ABC Notation of Tunes** by Shivam Raj, available on Kaggle. It includes a large collection of folk music tunes in ABC notation, a text-based music notation format, allowing the model to learn various musical patterns in melody, rhythm, and harmony.

## 🔧 Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MossabArektout/Music-Generation-using-RNN-LSTM.git
cd music-generation
```

## 🧠 Model
The model architecture is based on [RNNs/LSTMs]. This choice was made due to its ability to capture sequential dependencies in music, providing coherent melodic output over time.


## 🔍 Future Work
This project opens the door for future explorations, such as:

- Experimenting with different genres and musical styles
- Incorporating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for more diverse outputs
- Developing a user interface for interactive music generation
